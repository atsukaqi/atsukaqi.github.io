## Timeline
### History of Chinese New Year
The Timeline shows the origins and development of the Chinese New Year. As China's most important traditional festival, the Chinese New Year has a history of thousands of years. The Timeline shows the evolution from ancient sacrificial activities based on a farming culture to modern celebrations, including traditional customs such as family reunions, firecrackers and spring couplets.
In modern times, especially after the founding of the People's Republic of China(1949), the Chinese New Year was officially established as a national holiday. Traditional and modern elements have merged with each other in the celebration of the Chinese New Year, making it the most important holiday for Chinese people around the world.

### Source from [Worldmeter](https://www.worldometers.info/).
This Line Chart shows the changing trends in population growth rates in India, China and the United States over the past ten years. From the chart, we can see that India's population growth rate has remained at a high level, and although it has gradually slowed down, it is still ahead of China and the United States. In contrast, China's population growth rate has been declining year by year, and in 2021 it has become negative. Meanwhile, the population growth rate in the United States has been relatively stable, but it also declined in 2021 and then rebounded slightly.
